# in the environment.  Also, if make recognises that the child is another
# make (e.g. it's invoked as $(MAKE) or +command), it keeps open fd's 3
# and 4 to allow the child process to access the job server. Otherwise,
# those fd's aren't kept open.
# In the case where one does 'make -j 16 test_harness', this script is
# called with MAKEFLAGS set, but fd's 3 and 4 closed. Later when
# descendents of this script run cpan/ExtUtils-Constant/t/Constant.t
# which itelf invokes make, the warnings ensue.
