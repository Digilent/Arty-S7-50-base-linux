DESCRIPTION_make-dbg: Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.  Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files.  This package contains ELF symbols and related sources for debugging purposes.
